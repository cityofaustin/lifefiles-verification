# mypass-verification
This is a standalone site that performs the notarty verification of a document notarized by Mypass

This part of the project is still a work in progress.  Although we have a good idea about how to impliment VC/notarization verification, we are still working through the right way to communication decentralized verification to others in a way that a user can understand what is happening and trust that the verifications are correct. This is our current design: https://verificationsite.webflow.io/. 

Any feedback from the community is welcome!
